# Components Used
* Power supply
* Arduino UNO
* Motor
* Motor driver
* LCD
* Buzzer
* Temperature Sensor
## Arduno UNO
* Arduino Uno is a microcontroller board used has ATmega328 from AVR family which controls the all process to be carried out in the system.
* There are 14 digital input/output pins,6 Analog pins,a 16 MHz ceramic resonator,USB connection,power jack and also has reset button.
* It's software supported by a number of libraries that makes the programming easier.
##  Motor Driver
* L293D is a motor driver IC which is used to connect the motor with the microcontroller and provide them sufficient voltage supply to the design.
* L293D has 16-pins in which four are input pins,four are output pins,two are enable pin,four GND pins and two pins for power supply.It is used to control motors.
## Temperature Sensor
* A temperature sensor is a device used to measure temperature.
* The Temperature Sensor LM35 series are precision integrated-circuit temperature devices with an output voltage linearly proportional to the Centigrade temperature.
## LCD Display
* The term LCD stands for liquid crystal display. It is one kind of electronic display module used in an extensive range of applications like various circuits & devices like mobile phones, calculators, computers, TV sets, etc. These displays are mainly preferred for multi-segment light-emitting diodes and seven segments. 
* A 16×2 LCD has two registers like data register and command register. The RS (register select) is mainly used to change from one register to another. When the register set is ‘0’, then it is known as command register. Similarly, when the register set is ‘1’, then it is known as data register.
## Buzzer
* An arduino buzzer is also called a piezo buzzer. It is basically a tiny speaker that you can connect directly to an Arduino. You can make it sound a tone at a frequency you set.
