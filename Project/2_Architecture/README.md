# Components Used
* Power supply
* Arduino UNO
* Motor
* Motor driver
* LCD
* Buzzer
* Temperature Sensor
## Arduno UNO
* Arduino Uno is a microcontroller board used has ATmega328 from AVR family which controls the all process to be carried out in the system.
* There are 14 digital input/output pins,6 Analog pins,a 16 MHz ceramic resonator,USB connection,power jack and also has reset button.
* It's software supported by a number of libraries that makes the programming easier.
##  Motor Driver
* L293D is a motor driver IC which is used to connect the motor with the microcontroller and provide them sufficient voltage supply to the design.
* L293D has 16-pins in which four are input pins,four are output pins,two are enable pin,four GND pins and two pins for power supply.It is used to control motors.
## Temperature Sensor
* A temperature sensor is a device used to measure temperature.
* The Temperature Sensor LM35 series are precision integrated-circuit temperature devices with an output voltage linearly proportional to the Centigrade temperature.
## Hall effect sensor
* Hall Effect Sensor (A3144) to Measure Rotations from a Fan.A tachometer is a useful tool for calculating the rotational motion of a part. Tachometers read out revolutions per minute (RPM), which tells the user how often a rotating part completes one full rotation
